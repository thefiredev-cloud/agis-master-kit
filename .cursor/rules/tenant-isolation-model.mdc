description: Defines the multi-tenant security model for resource isolation and usage tracking across customer workspaces

# tenant-isolation-model

The tenant isolation model implements three core components:

## Resource Isolation (Score: 85)
`agis-platform-build.plan.md`
- Tenant-specific database schemas with row-level security (RLS)
- Isolated connector configurations per tenant workspace
- Secure credential vault partitioned by tenant ID
- Scope-based whitelist system for controlling agent access

## Usage Controls (Score: 80)
`agis-platform/app/(marketing)/pricing/page.tsx`
- Run quota enforcement per tenant (1,000-10,000 runs/month)
- Real-time budget tracking across agent executions
- Overage detection and billing at $0.10 per additional run
- Service level enforcement by subscription tier

## Multi-Control-Plane Architecture (Score: 90)
`agis-platform-build.plan.md`
- Isolated control planes per tenant for external service integration
- Tenant-specific connector configurations and authentication
- Secure credential management system partitioned by tenant
- Cross-tenant resource access prevention

Key Implementation Rules:
1. All database queries must include tenant_id filtering
2. Connector credentials stored in tenant-specific vault sections
3. Agent execution requires tenant budget validation
4. Resource access limited to tenant's assigned control plane
5. Usage metering tracked at tenant granularity
