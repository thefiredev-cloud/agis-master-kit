Core Usage-Based Pricing Formula:
```
total_cost = base_fee + (tool_calls × $0.01) + (tokens × $0.000002)
```

Billing Components (Importance Score: 85):

1. Usage Metering
- Run-based quota tracking per tenant (1,000-10,000 runs/month)
- Real-time consumption monitoring across agent executions
- Overage calculation at $0.10 per additional run

2. Tiered Pricing Structure (`/pricing/page.tsx`)
- Base tier includes quota allocation
- Service level definitions per tier
- Hybrid model combining:
  - Seat licenses for user access
  - Usage-based billing for agent executions
  - Tool integration fees

3. Multi-tenant Billing Isolation
- Tenant-specific usage tracking
- Isolated billing cycles
- Separate overage calculations

4. Agent-Specific Cost Factors (`/lib/agents-data.ts`)
- Different base costs by agent type
- Tool integration surcharges
- Additional fees for specialized capabilities

Key Business Rules:
1. Budget validation required before agent execution
2. Usage metering occurs post-execution
3. Tier-specific service level guarantees
4. Multi-tenant billing isolation requirements
