# Push to GitHub & Deploy to Netlify

Your app is ready for GitHub! Follow these steps to push and deploy.

## Step 1: Create a GitHub Repository

1. Go to [GitHub](https://github.com/new)
2. Create a new repository:
   - **Repository name:** `agis-platform`
   - **Description:** AGIS - Artificial General Intelligence as a Service Platform
   - **Public** (recommended for open-source)
   - **Do NOT initialize with README** (we have one)
   - Click **"Create repository"**

## Step 2: Add Remote and Push Code

Run these commands in your terminal:

```bash
cd /Users/tannerosterkamp/Downloads/AGIS\ Master\ Kit/agis-platform

# Add GitHub as remote (replace USERNAME with your GitHub username)
git remote add origin https://github.com/USERNAME/agis-platform.git

# Push to GitHub
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

**Example if your GitHub username is `thefiredev-cloud`:**
```bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/thefiredev-cloud/agis-platform.git
git push -u origin main
```

## Step 3: Verify Push

Go to your GitHub repo URL to verify the code is there:
- https://github.com/USERNAME/agis-platform

## Step 4: Connect to Netlify

Once code is on GitHub:

1. Go to [Netlify Dashboard](https://app.netlify.com)
2. Click **"New site from Git"**
3. Click **"Connect to Git"** ‚Üí **GitHub**
4. Search for and select **`agis-platform`**
5. **Build settings** should auto-detect:
   - Build command: `npm ci && npm run build`
   - Publish directory: `.next`
6. Click **"Deploy site"**

**That's it!** Netlify will automatically:
- Build your app
- Use the env vars from `.env.production.local`
- Deploy to https://agis-platform.netlify.app

## Step 5: Future Deployments

Every time you push to GitHub:
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "your message"
git push origin main
```

Netlify will automatically rebuild and redeploy! üöÄ

## ‚úÖ What's Included for Zero-Config Testing

- ‚úÖ `.env.production.local` with all test keys
- ‚úÖ `netlify.toml` with build configuration
- ‚úÖ Production-ready Next.js build
- ‚úÖ System fonts (no network dependencies)
- ‚úÖ ESLint warnings fixed
- ‚úÖ Security headers configured

The app will work immediately on Netlify without any additional environment variable configuration!

## üìù Notes

- The `.env.production.local` file contains **test keys only**
- Before going to production, replace with real production keys
- Do NOT commit `.env.local` (local development only)
